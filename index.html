			<p>Hello! <br><br>Welcome to my website! What's here? Information about me! Wait... Do I really want to do that?? Hmm... What the hey! Let's do it!
				<br>
				<br>
				My goal with this website is to learn a little bit about web development. It looks really bare for now because... I don't know much about the front-end realm. 
				Hehe
				<br>
				<br>
				Whelp hopefully this website gets better in time. Stay tuned! Until then, thank you for checking this out.
				<br>
				<br>
				Don't forget to be awesome,
				<br>
				Josh</p>
