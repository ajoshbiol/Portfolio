					Six Word Stories is a project inspired by a friend. The premise of the project is to express a story in six words only. It may just look like a bunch of
					nonsense to you but to me this project means a lot. I like this project because it serves an outlet for me to express my inner thoughts and feeling out to 
					the public without people really understanding what I am saying because they have no context. These six word stories are purposely left ambiguous so that
					you never really understand what I am thinking but it gives me the catharsis that I needed at the time. This project leverages Twitter as the primary medium in which I release my stories.

					I sometimes play the video game League of Legends for fun. I am no good at it but I enjoy it because of the people. It's a nice social outlet at the end
					of the day; playing video games with friends and chatting about our day on teamspeak.
